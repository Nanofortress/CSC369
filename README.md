# CSC369

my assignments for CSC369 Operating Systems course at UofT

It's an awesome course, with quite some code to write!
Well done, [Karen](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~reid/) and [Angela](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~demke/)!

### Note for UofT students

I know some of you are looking at this repo while you take the course. Use at your own risk -- do not plagarize, Markus will detect you.
